## Daily
上午去医院拿了药。一天都没干什么正事，检查了一下西瓜上周的工作。和圈圈说了一下写实时开台单的需求，让西瓜在下个版本先做。

## Quote

1. "A quick and easy tip for building habits that last:

Pick a standard time and place to do it.

It’s easier to wake up knowing "I exercise at 4pm" than to decide each time when to fit a habit into your day.

If it’s already decided, all you need to do is show up."

决定明早去跑步，看看能不能坚持下来。


2. "Spend more time searching for better information sources.

A body filled with junk food struggles to move well.

A mind filled with junk thoughts struggles to think well."

是 information sources 而非 Information。


3. "Different meanings can be assigned to the same events.

Look for evidence of how the world is encouraging you, and you will find it.

Look for evidence of how the world is burdening you, and you will find it.

Choose an explanation that empowers you."

好坏可能只在观念之间。同样是熬夜，加班可能让人痛不欲生，愤怒控诉；玩游戏或者打麻将又会让人乐不思蜀。

4. Theoretical physicist **Richard Feynman** with some advice for life:

"Fall in love with some activity, and do it! Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough. Work as hard and as much as you want to on the things you like to do the best. Don't think about what you want to be, but what you want to do. Keep up some kind of a minimum with other things so that society doesn't stop you from doing anything at all."

费曼这个观点简单就是“热爱生活，努力生活”？　Don't think about what you want to be, but what you want to do.
